# Forensic Methodology & Framework Guide

## Overview
This application is a **Non-Linear Knowledge Base**. Documents are not just stored; they are "docked" into a neural web. 

## Relationality Checklist (Integrity Check)
Before finalizing any document in `vault.ts`, verify the following:
1. **The Parent Link**: Does it link to at least one **Theory** node?
2. **The Sibling Link**: Does it link to at least one **Narrative** or **Song** node?
3. **The Semantic Anchors**: Does it contain at least two `clink` spans?
4. **ID Accuracy**: Are the `linksTo` strings perfectly lowercase and hyphenated?

## VS Code Instructions
To maintain this project efficiently:
- **Snippets**: Type `vault-entry` inside the `VAULT` array.
- **Linking**: Type `clink` inside any `rawContent` string.

## Classification Guide
- **Unclassified**: General public documentation.
- **Confidential**: Relational dynamics and sensitive logs.
- **Restricted**: Tactical methodology (Psych Warfare).
- **Redacted**: Active surveillance counter-measures.
