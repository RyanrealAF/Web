# Forensic Linkage Explorer: Scalability Manifesto

## AI & Developer Integration Instructions
This system is architected for "Forensic Fidelity"—the ability to trace a complex web of social and psychological warfare through multiple media formats. Follow these strict patterns for expansion:

### 1. The Development Pipeline (Vault Folder Pattern)
- **Do not** manually inject nodes into `constants.tsx` unless they are "Foundational Bedrock" theories.
- Use `vault.ts` for all ingested case studies, logs, and artistic works.
- Appending a new `IngestedDocument` to the `VAULT` array triggers the automated ingestion engine, which generates slug-safe IDs and default connectivity.

### 2. Forensic Relationality
- **Semantic Anchors**: Use the `conceptLink(id, text)` helper in all `rawContent` strings. This creates the "Neural Paths" used for navigation.
- **Link Types**:
  - `defines`: Structural dependencies. Use for theoretical frameworks mapping to their components.
  - `depicts`: Narrative instances of theory. Use for real-world logs (e.g., San Diego tests) mapping to their psychological counterparts.
  - `contradicts`: Ideological friction. Crucial for mapping gaslighting vs. sovereignty.
- **Back-Linking**: Always ensure a new entry links to at least one theoretical node and one narrative node to prevent "Island Nodes".

### 3. Aesthetics & UX
- **Brutalist Design**: The UI must maintain high contrast (`#080808` background, `#f97316` primary).
- **Zoom-to-Web**: The interaction model forces a "moment of pause" in the graph before document entry. This reinforces the interconnected nature of the documents.

### 4. Technical Constraints
- **Performance**: The D3 simulation is optimized for ~200 nodes. Beyond this, migrate to a canvas-based rendering engine.
- **Slug Integrity**: Node IDs generated by the ingestion engine must be used as `linksTo` targets. Do not use plain text titles as link targets.
